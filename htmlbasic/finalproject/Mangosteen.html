        Mangosteen <small>(Garcinia mangostana)</small> is a tropical fruit that
        is often referred to as the "queen of fruits." It is native to Southeast
        Asia but is now cultivated in various tropical regions around the world.
        The mangosteen is a small, round fruit with a thick, purple or reddish
        rind and soft, white, juicy flesh on the inside. Here are some key
        characteristics of the mangosteen fruit:
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Rind: The outer rind of the mangosteen is thick, leathery, and
            inedible. It is typically purple or reddish when ripe and contains
            natural compounds called xanthones, which are believed to have
            various health benefits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flesh: Inside the rind, the mangosteen has segments of juicy,
            snow-white, and aromatic flesh. The flesh is sweet and slightly
            tart, with a unique and delightful flavor often described as a
            combination of peach, strawberry, and citrus notes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Segments: The number of flesh segments can vary, but a typical
            mangosteen contains between 4 to 8 segments, each containing a seed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seeds: Each segment contains one or more seeds, which are usually
            inedible due to their bitter taste. It's the flesh that is prized
            for its flavor and is the main edible part of the fruit.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        Mangosteen is highly regarded for its delicious taste and is often
        enjoyed fresh as a dessert or snack. It's also used in various culinary
        applications, such as salads, preserves, juices, and ice creams.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to its culinary uses, mangosteen has gained attention for
        its potential health benefits due to the presence of xanthones and other
        bioactive compounds. It is sometimes referred to as a "superfruit"
        because of its perceived antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,
        although more research is needed to fully understand and confirm these
        potential health benefits.

        <br />
        Mangosteen is known for its distinctive appearance and exquisite flavor,
        and it is considered a prized and exotic fruit in many parts of the
        world.
