        A <strong>mango</strong> is a fruit, and when people refer to a "mango
        fruit," they are typically talking about the edible part of the mango,
        which is the flesh or pulp that you consume. Mangoes belong to the
        botanical genus Mangifera, and the edible portion of the fruit is the
        sweet and juicy flesh that surrounds a large, flat, and inedible seed or
        pit. This flesh is commonly referred to as "mango meat."
