        <b>Durian is a tropical fruit known for its distinctive appearance,</b>
        strong odor, and unique flavor. It is often called the "king of fruits,"
        although its strong smell can be off-putting to some people. Here are
        some key characteristics of the durian fruit:
        <br />
        <ol>

            Appearance: The durian is a large fruit, typically round or oblong,
            and can grow to be quite large, often weighing several pounds. It is
            covered with a hard, spiky shell or husk, which must be opened to
            access the edible flesh inside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Odor: Durian is infamous for its strong and pungent odor, which can
            be described as overpowering, unpleasant, or even offensive to some
            individuals. It is often banned in public places and transportation
            due to its odor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flesh: Inside the husk, the durian contains creamy, custard-like
            flesh that is pale yellow or off-white in color. The flesh has a
            rich and complex flavor that is often described as a combination of
            sweet, savory, and slightly nutty notes. Some people find it
            delicious and enjoyable, while others may not like it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Varieties: There are several varieties of durian, each with its own
            flavor and texture characteristics. Some are known for being
            sweeter, while others have a more savory or bitter taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seeds: Durian flesh surrounds large seeds, which are typically not
            edible. The edible part is the flesh, which is what people eat.

        its potential health benefits due to the presence of xanthones and other
        bioactive compounds. It is sometimes referred to as a "superfruit"

        although more research is needed to fully understand and confirm these
        potential health benefits.
