        A <em>coconut</em> is indeed a fruit, specifically a drupe. A drupe is a
        type of fruit that has three layers: an outer layer, a fleshy middle
        layer, and a hard inner layer surrounding the seed. In the case of a
        coconut:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>The outer layer is the thick, fibrous, and hairy husk.</li>
          <li>
            The fleshy middle layer is the edible part known as coconut meat or
            copra.
          </li>
          <li>
            The hard inner layer is the woody shell that protects the seed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Inside the coconut, you'll also find coconut water, which is the liquid
        enclosed within the seed. This combination of layers and the seed inside
        makes the coconut a drupe, and it's one of the largest and most
        well-known drupe fruits in the world. While it's often referred to as a
        "coconut fruit," it's more accurately described as a drupe because of
        its specific botanical characteristics.
