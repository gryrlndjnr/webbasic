          Mangosteen <small>(Garcinia mangostana)</small> is a tropical fruit
          that is often referred to as the "queen of fruits." It is native to
          Southeast Asia but is now cultivated in various tropical regions
          around the world. The mangosteen is a small, round fruit with a thick,
          purple or reddish rind and soft, white, juicy flesh on the inside.
          Here are some key characteristics of the mangosteen fruit:
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              Rind: The outer rind of the mangosteen is thick, leathery, and
              inedible. It is typically purple or reddish when ripe and contains
              natural compounds called xanthones, which are believed to have
              various health benefits.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flesh: Inside the rind, the mangosteen has segments of juicy,
              snow-white, and aromatic flesh. The flesh is sweet and slightly
              tart, with a unique and delightful flavor often described as a
              combination of peach, strawberry, and citrus notes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Segments: The number of flesh segments can vary, but a typical
              mangosteen contains between 4 to 8 segments, each containing a
              seed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Seeds: Each segment contains one or more seeds, which are usually
              inedible due to their bitter taste. It's the flesh that is prized
              for its flavor and is the main edible part of the fruit.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          Mangosteen is highly regarded for its delicious taste and is often
          enjoyed fresh as a dessert or snack. It's also used in various
          culinary applications, such as salads, preserves, juices, and ice
          creams.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition to its culinary uses, mangosteen has gained attention for
          its potential health benefits due to the presence of xanthones and
          other bioactive compounds. It is sometimes referred to as a
          "superfruit" because of its perceived antioxidant and
          anti-inflammatory properties, although more research is needed to
          fully understand and confirm these potential health benefits.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Mangosteen is known for its distinctive appearance and exquisite
          flavor, and it is considered a prized and exotic fruit in many parts
          of the world.
