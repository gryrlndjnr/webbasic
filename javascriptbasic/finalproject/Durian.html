          strong odor, and unique flavor. It is often called the "king of
          fruits," although its strong smell can be off-putting to some people.
          Here are some key characteristics of the durian fruit:
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              Appearance: The durian is a large fruit, typically round or
              oblong, and can grow to be quite large, often weighing several
              pounds. It is covered with a hard, spiky shell or husk, which must
              be opened to access the edible flesh inside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Odor: Durian is infamous for its strong and pungent odor, which
              can be described as overpowering, unpleasant, or even offensive to
              some individuals. It is often banned in public places and
              transportation due to its odor.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flesh: Inside the husk, the durian contains creamy, custard-like
              flesh that is pale yellow or off-white in color. The flesh has a
              rich and complex flavor that is often described as a combination
              of sweet, savory, and slightly nutty notes. Some people find it
              delicious and enjoyable, while others may not like it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Varieties: There are several varieties of durian, each with its
              own flavor and texture characteristics. Some are known for being
              sweeter, while others have a more savory or bitter taste.
            </li>
            <li>
              Seeds: Durian flesh surrounds large seeds, which are typically not
              edible. The edible part is the flesh, which is what people eat.
            </li>
          </ol>

          Durian is a popular fruit in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries
          like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is often
          eaten fresh, but it is also used in a variety of desserts, candies,
          and snacks. Some people consider durian a delicacy and appreciate its
          unique taste, while others find its smell and flavor unappealing.

          In addition to its culinary uses, mangosteen has gained attention for
          its potential health benefits due to the presence of xanthones and
          other bioactive compounds. It is sometimes referred to as a
          "superfruit" because of its perceived antioxidant and
          anti-inflammatory properties, although more research is needed to
          fully understand and confirm these potential health benefits.

          The strong odor of durian can be polarizing, and it's important to
          note that there are places where it is prohibited in public areas like
          hotels, buses, and airports due to the smell. If you're curious about
          durian, it's worth trying it to see whether you enjoy its taste, but
          be prepared for the intense aroma that often accompanies it. world.
